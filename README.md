## Projects

### [HAJKEN-car](https://github.com/EmanuelDellsen/group-05)
The team and I got the opportunity to work with a miniature car and through the use of different sensors and readers create a car which would end up avoiding obstacles and perform manouvers. We also wrote an detailed README which can be found [here](https://github.com/EmanuelDellsen/group-05) containing more information.



### [StadsTid](https://github.com/EmanuelDellsen/StadsTid)
Me and [Karl](https://github.com/Synoecism) attended a Hackathon called ["Hack the crisis Sweden"](https://www.ai.se/en/events/hack-crisis-0#:~:text=Hack%20the%20Crisis%20is%20an,of%20Sweden%20and%20the%20world.) where we created a skeleton MVP as our contribution to the competition which lasted over one weekend.


### [AirWork](https://github.com/EmanuelDellsen/airwork)
Me and [Karl](https://github.com/Synoecism) has throughout the years discussed different ideas and this is an example of the outcome. 
The plan is to create a displayable and functioning MVP of an idea which has grown over the years, [this](https://github.com/EmanuelDellsen/airwork) repository is the result.


### [Self driving car](https://github.com/EmanuelDellsen/DIT638-Cyber-Physical-Systems-and-Systems-of-Systems)
The team and I created a microservice which was reponsible for calculating steering angles based on video feed received from another microservice. 
The video feed was processed through several parts of the microservice in order to detect objects and based on said objects calculate a steering angle.
If interested there is a README in the [repository](https://github.com/EmanuelDellsen/DIT638-Cyber-Physical-Systems-and-Systems-of-Systems) that covers everything in detail.

### [Distributed system](https://github.com/EmanuelDellsen/DIT355-Distributed-Systems-Development-)
Created a distributed system using different architectural patterns, technologies and libraries. 
More information and specifics is to be found at the [here](https://github.com/EmanuelDellsen/DIT355-Distributed-Systems-Development-)  


### [TextMod](https://github.com/hajke-gu/text-mod) 
Me and my team created a product using native JavaScript in collaboration with [Tibco Spotfire](https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-spotfire). This was done by programming an "add-on" within their sandbox environment [Tibco Labs](https://www.tibco.com/tibco-labs) where anyone can create their own module where only your imagination is the limit.
